>  VICREO Listener is a small program that sits on your machine waiting for incomming TCP connection/commands. It uses pre-defined commands to simulate keypresses on your machine. You can use this program to preform hotkey actions from remote

## Installation

Download the right software package for your operating system and launch the program on the machine you would like to control (host).

On your client machine (the one you are sending commands from), send TCP string to the right IP-address from the host, to port 10001

## Usage

Below you'll find a table of pre-installed commands that the listener will accept. Firt tell the program what kind of key you are going to send and than the key itself.

| Action					| Description									| Example								|
| --------------- | --------------------------- |-----------------------|
| &lt;SK&gt;						| Single key								|&lt;SK&gt;n  								|
| &lt;SPK&gt;						| Special key (modifier)		|&lt;SKP&gt;enter 								|
| &lt;KCOMBO&gt;	&lt;AND&gt;	| Key combination							|&lt;KCOMBO&gt;alt&lt;AND&gt;tab  	|
| &lt;KTRIO&gt;	&lt;AND&gt;	&lt;AND2&gt;	| Key trio combination							|&lt;KCOMBO&gt;ctrl&lt;AND&gt;shift&lt;AND2&gt;d  	|
| &lt;KPRESS&gt;				| Simulates key down					|&lt;KPRESS&gt;n					  	|
| &lt;KRELEASE&gt;			| Simulates key up						|&lt;KRELEASE&gt;n				  	|
| &lt;MSG&gt;						| Send message								|&lt;MSG&gt;Hello World (only string message)		|
| &lt;FILE&gt;					| Open file (complete path)		|&lt;FILE&gt;c:\user\test\test.bat
| &lt;SKE&gt;	&lt;PROCESS&gt; &lt;AND&gt;	&lt;AND2&gt;	| (MacOS ONLY) - Send KeyPress Event to Process	|&lt;SKE&gt;0x12&lt;PROCESS&gt;propresenter&lt;AND&gt;cmd&lt;AND2&gt;none

The &lt;KPRESS&gt; and &lt;KRELEASE&gt; can be used for special cases, Example;<br>
&lt;KPRESS&gt;ctrl<br>
&lt;KPRESS&gt;c<br>
&lt;KRELEASE&gt;c<br>
&lt;KRELEASE&gt;ctrl<br>

but above is the same as &lt;KCOMBO&gt;ctrl&lt;AND&gt;c

## &lt;SKE&gt; (MacOS Only) - Notes ##
The &lt;SKE&gt;*keyCode*&lt;PROCESS&gt;*processSearchString*&lt;AND&gt;*optionalModidifierKey1*&lt;AND2&gt;*optionalModidifierKey2* command (MacOS only) will send a keyboard keypress event directly to a specific process identified by name (Process name given in the command does not have to be complete).
Please note that this works through a quite different mechanism than the other commands and it is MacOS only. You will won't often need this command as the other commands to send Keys are likely to do what you need.  However, this command can help if you need to send hotkeys to an application running in the background.

This command is virtually sending physical keyboard events with the keys identified by a KeyCode. You must give the keyboard keycode - not the character/letter being typed.

For example, if you send keycode 0 and your computer is setup to use a US keyboard as your current input, that will be like pressing the key with the letter **A** on it. If however, your keyboard is Greek, then sending KeyCode 0 will be like typing the letter **Î±**. Think of it as pressing a physical key in a specific location on a keyboard.  You can lookup MacOS keyboard keycodes online or refer to the map of the US keyboard below:
![KeyCodes](Apple%20Keyboard%20KeyCodes.jpg)
The map above shows the hex keycodes in green (you can also send the decimal equivilant if you like).
Generally, keyboards for other languages will have the **same KeyCodes for keys in the same locations** - they just have different letters printed on them.

Also, note that the events are directed at the running process itself (Not the foreground application, Window or Text Control). This means it is possible to send these keyboard events to applications running in the background on MacOS.  However, depending on how the application is processing keyboard input, **this only works in very limited cases.** 
It will most likely work for application-wide hotkeys. See how your application responds - your mileage may vary.

> Be aware there is a limit of 160 bytes to receive, this because of the &lt;MSG&gt; function

> Make sure you use the backslash in the file open command

For mac, when you need the path of a file, right-click on the file and when you see the menu, press and hold Alt to be able to copy the full path.
